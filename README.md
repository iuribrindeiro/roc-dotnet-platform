# roc-dotnet-platform
DotNet platform example for the [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/) language

How to run it:

1. Build the roc app using the roc platform under the root:

```cli
roc build main.roc --lib --output ./platform/interop
```
This will produce a shared library file that we'll be able to import from a .NET context.
See: https://github.com/iuribrindeiro/roc-dotnet-platform/blob/main/platform/Program.cs#L14

2. `cd` into the `platform` folder and run:
```cli
dotnet run
```

This should print the message under the `roc.main` file bound to the expression name `main`.
See: https://github.com/iuribrindeiro/roc-dotnet-platform/blob/main/main.roc#L6


If you want to build the app using native AOT:

1. Publish the dotnet app
```cli
dotnet publish -c Release
```

2. `cd` into the into the `publish` folder and run the binary:
```cli
./DotNetRocPlatform
```
